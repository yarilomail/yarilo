	// separator when the namespace speaks a different one. The collision is

	// ".a.b" on disk, so one folder answers for two names.
	//
	// It is a key of its own rather than part of ValidateFSNames because it is
	// retroactive in a way the others are not. The others refuse names no user
	// meant to own; this one refuses "example.com" and "Invoices.2026" --
	// ordinary names that existing mailboxes may already carry. Folding it in
	// would leave an operator with such folders only one remedy, turning off
	// the traversal checks as well: the deployment that most needs the
	// protection would be advised to disable it.
	RefuseLayoutSeparator bool

	// StorageEscapeChar, when set, supersedes the two refusals that exist
	// because such a name could not be represented on disk: the layout
	// separator appearing literally, and a reserved segment. Escaping stores
	// them faithfully instead, so refusing them as well would reject exactly
	// the names escaping exists to allow (#1078).
	//
	// The traversal refusals are unaffected: ".." is not a name anyone means
	// to own, and escaping it would create a folder no client asked for.

	// ReservedSegments are names a single hierarchy segment may not equal:
	// the layout's own internal directories (cur/new/tmp, dbox-Mails). A
	// folder called "cur" collides with maildir's own subdirectory and
	// corrupts the mailbox without ever leaving it, so this is a distinct
	// hazard from traversal rather than more of the same.

	// such a folder is refused access to a folder that exists -- so it is a
	// knob rather than a constant.

// from one to the other, and whether a ".." survived the rewrite decided
// whether it escaped. Refusing the layout separator outright when it is not the

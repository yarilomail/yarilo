// NamespaceUserInfo builds the UserInfo a non-personal namespace's storage
// handles resolve against: the session's identity, with every path field taken
// from the namespace's own location.
//
// It exists because two callers built this structure from one ParseLocation and
// differed by five fields. The IMAP path set all of them; the admin API set
// Username and Home. Those two are not equivalent -- with MailPath unset the
// consumers fall into different defaults, a maildir backend to Home/Maildir and
// the ACL store to Home -- so the admin API looked for a mailbox in
// <root>/Maildir/.News while its ACL file sat in <root>/, and every per-mailbox
// admin ACL call on a shared namespace answered "folder not found" for a
// mailbox that was plainly there (#1109).
//
// Driver matters for the same reason one step further out: unset, the bundle
// falls back to the deployment-wide driver rather than the one the namespace's
// location names, which is correct only while every namespace uses one format.
//
// separator comes from the namespace spec rather than from base: it is a
// property of the namespace, and the personal one may use another.
//
// An empty loc.Path is refused rather than defaulted. Every field here exists
// because a consumer left to its own default resolves somewhere else, so a
// constructor that accepted an empty root would reintroduce the class it is
// meant to close -- and it would do so from the one place that is supposed to
// make it impossible. The reference asserts at the same point.

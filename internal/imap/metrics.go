// parts is the cost still unaccounted for, and that remainder is the finding.

// (10.3ms) against SEARCH (4.5ms) it answered "both under 25.6ms": true, and
// no help. A histogram that cannot separate two commands differing by 2x
// cannot answer the question this one is read for (#1462).
//
// Doubling between 1ms and 128ms buys that resolution; the decade below and
// the long tail above stay coarse, because nobody reads a quantile of IDLE.

// changes, and quantiles are what a tail investigation needs.

// The maildir proactive scan, as a whole and as a decision.
//
// It is the one thing maildir does on SELECT that the index-authoritative
// drivers do not: walk cur/ and new/ so a message delivered by an MDA or moved
// by a second MUA appears without an operator rebuild. That is a correctness
// property, not waste — but it is also the named suspect for maildir's SELECT
// being the most expensive of the three drivers (#1265), and a suspect without
// a number is an opinion.
//
// The skipped count is the interesting half. The scan is already gated on a
// change token, so in principle a folder nobody touched costs a stat and
// nothing else; if skips stay at zero under a workload that re-selects
// unchanged folders, the gate is not reaching the case it was built for.
// metricUnreadable counts messages a command answered short because it could
// not read them. The event is one event -- the server answered with less than
// it knows, and nothing in the answer says so (#1283) -- so it is one series
// with the command as a label. An alert on it is one expression, not a sum of
// series that someone must remember to extend when a third command starts
// scanning.
//
// FETCH counts here too, and did not until #1532. A message whose record the
// driver cannot read is answered as `* n FETCH ()` -- present in the mailbox,
// counted by SELECT, its size served from the index, and every content section
// empty. That is indistinguishable to a client from an empty message, and it
// is what both format faults we have ever had looked like: this counter stayed
// at zero through both of them.

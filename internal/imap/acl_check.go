// namespace root, exactly as before that feature existed. A failed grant can
// leave a mailbox nobody can administer -- and it is sticky: the next CREATE of
// the same name fails with "already exists", so nothing self-heals, and
// repairing it needs the very right that is missing (#1334).
//
// The window is not theoretical. CREATE is a local mkdir; the ACL write goes
// through yarilo-locks -- a separate deployment, over the network, with a
// 30-second acquisition timeout. A rolling upgrade of that deployment is tens
// of seconds during which the two can disagree.

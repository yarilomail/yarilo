// Cache keeps folded sidecars in memory, because folding one is O(account) and

//
// Measured on this machine, folding costs 0.39ms at a thousand messages, 2.7ms
// at ten thousand and 37.7ms at a hundred thousand. A delivery costs single
// milliseconds, so reading the sidecar per message would make delivery two to
// three times slower for the accounts that can least afford it -- the same
// O(account)-per-message trap the log format exists to avoid, entered from the
// other side.
//
// Bounded by idleness, not by process lifetime (#1396): a cache of every
// account ever delivered to holds their maps until restart, and an account
// nobody has written to in an hour is exactly the one whose memory should go
// back.

// for the read, or hand readers a snapshot. Written here rather than
// discovered there, since the code will look like it simply works.
//
// Freshness is decided by size and mtime rather than by trusting the cache: the
// caller holds the account's thread lock, but a process that held the lock a
// moment ago may have appended, and threading from a stale state assigns a
// second thread id to a conversation that already has one.

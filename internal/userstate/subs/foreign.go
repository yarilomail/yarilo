// ReadForeign returns the folder names another implementation's subscription
// file holds, in the form a client sees them.
//
// Their file and ours share a name and, on many deployments, a directory: ours
// lives in the control root, which is the mail path unless a deployment moves
// it, and theirs lives with the mail. So this is not only the conversion's
// business -- an ordinary read has to tell the two apart, or a store nobody has
// converted yet answers LIST with their version header as a subscribed folder
// (#1583).
//
// Two things about that file are not guessable and were read off a real one
// rather than reasoned about:
//
//   - the names are stored in modified UTF-7, not UTF-8, so a Cyrillic folder
//     appears as &BBIERQRWBDQEPQRW- and reaches a client as mojibake if carried
//     across verbatim;
//   - in version 2 the levels of a nested name are separated by a tab, each
//     level escaped separately, so Archive/2026 is "Archive\t2026". A reader
//     splitting on the hierarchy separator finds one name where there are two
//     levels, and subscribes the user to a folder that does not exist.
//
// Version 1 files have no header and one whole name per line; they are read
// too, because a store that old is exactly the kind somebody migrates.

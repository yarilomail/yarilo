// POP3 reads its maildrop once, at login, and answers every later command from
// that snapshot. What makes the read safe to serve without the cross-process
// lock is not the read but what deletion addresses: a UID taken from the
// snapshot, never a position in a freshly read index. A snapshot one delivery
// behind then narrows the session's view — legal under RFC 1939, which requires
// a constant maildrop for the session — instead of misdirecting a DELE onto a
// message the client never saw.

// that started addressing by position has to fail this row, and it only can if

// Package director — Membership implements the self-organizing director
// ring: members ordered by (ip, port), each node dialing its right
// neighbor, joined via an HMAC-authenticated JOIN against a seed. Routing
// truth stays the deterministic ring hash (pkg/cluster/ring); membership
// only shares routing state between neighbors.
//
// Degradation ladder (must hold at every member count):
//
//	N=1: no neighbors, no peer connections — single-replica mode.
//	N=2: left == right; only the lower (ip,port) member dials — one
//	     connection serves both directions.
//	N=3+: every member dials its right neighbor; N directed edges.
//
// See the internal docs for the wire format.

// dial computed from this node's own — possibly divergent — member view.
// Under concurrent formation those single dials are not guaranteed to

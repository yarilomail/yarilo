// What a read command costs inside the index, as a whole and in named parts.
//
// The folder index is the one layer maildir and sdbox share, which is where the
// 24-32% gap to the reference has to live: the two drivers have nothing else in
// common below the session (#1229). None of it was measured — the lock path
// logged at debug level and nothing else was timed at all — so a per-command
// number could say a command costs 25ms without saying whether that is the
// round trip to the lock service, the freshness check, or rebuilding the
// folder's message list for the tenth time in a row.
//
// The parts are observed only inside the whole, and what the whole holds beyond
// them is the finding. It cannot be negative, and a test asserts it.

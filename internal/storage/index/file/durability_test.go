// The conversion asks for a durable flush, and the removal comes after it.
//
// A source check, and deliberately so. What has to hold is an ordering between
// three calls -- the base rewrite is told to fsync, the directory entry is
// synced, their index is unlinked -- and the states it protects against only
// appear when the machine stops between two of them. Everything reachable from
// a running test is downstream of the ordering being right; this is upstream of
// it.
//
// The flush is not durable anywhere else in this package, because everywhere
// else the state still exists somewhere when a tail is lost. Here it does not:
// the other copy is deleted a few lines later (#1524).

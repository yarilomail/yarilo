// Package crlf turns bare LF into CRLF as bytes are read, without holding the
// message in memory.
//
// Mail this server writes is CRLF-terminated before it reaches the disk, so
// nothing here changes it. A record another dbox v2 implementation wrote can be
// stored with bare LF, and serving those bytes as they lie puts bare LF on the
// wire, which RFC 3501 does not allow (#1527).
//
// Streaming rather than rewriting on import: converting the stored bytes would
// be exactly the conversion the record format exists to avoid.

// Reader wraps r and terminates every line with CRLF.
//
// Idempotent: a CR already in front of an LF is left alone, so text that is
// already CRLF passes through byte for byte and a second wrapping changes
// nothing. That property is what lets the wrapper sit on a path where most
// bodies need no conversion at all.
//
// A body that needs no conversion is read straight into the caller's buffer and
// costs one scan and nothing else -- no intermediate buffer, no allocation. The
// holdover below is allocated the first time a bare LF is actually found, so
// ordinary mail never pays for it. That matters because this sits on the fetch
// path, where reading a 512 KB body to serve its header was itself a defect
// (#1517).

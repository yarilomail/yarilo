// Applying the tail twice must leave the same mailbox as applying it once.
//
// This is not caution, it is the format. The base is synced up to
// log_file_head_offset, but the records between tail and head have not
// necessarily reached the mailbox, so the reference re-reads from tail. A
// reader that starts there therefore sees changes the base already absorbed --
// and one that applied them blindly would deliver a message twice.
//
// Hand-built rather than taken from a fixture, and deliberately: a base whose
// tail is behind its head exists only between a commit and the sync that
// follows it, so no store captured at rest can carry one. What is asserted is
// behaviour, not layout.

// metricDeliverySeconds is one recipient's delivery, end to end: from the point
// the message is in hand to the status this server reports for that recipient.
//
// Whole path, not one seam of it. The promise a delivery metric makes is that
// a regression shows up on a graph rather than in a complaint, and the next
// regression may have nothing to do with the seam that prompted this one.
//
// Rejections are timed too, under their own outcome: a mailbox that rejects
// slowly is still a mailbox that answers slowly, and a quota check that walks
// every folder is exactly the kind of cost that hides when only the happy path
// is measured.
//
// Buckets start at half a millisecond because a sandbox delivery is single
// milliseconds; the tail reaches minutes because a delivery waiting on a
// mailbox lock does.
